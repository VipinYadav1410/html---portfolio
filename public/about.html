    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey all, <br />
        "Hello, I'm Vipin Yadav, a resident of Gurgaon with a passion for web development. I hold a B.Tech in ECE from MRIU Faridabad. With experience as a web designer/developer at Jlloyds Ventures for 18 months and as a Project Coordinator at Premcell Technology Private Limited for over 4 years, I've honed my skills in both technical and project management domains. Now, eager to transition back to web development, I'm excited about the opportunity to leverage my expertise and contribute to innovative projects in this field."
